Description: Fast implementation of a key-value store. Environments are commonly used as key-value stores, but every time a new key is used, it is added to R's global symbol table, causing a small amount of memory leakage. This can be problematic in cases where many different keys are used. Fastmap avoids this memory leak issue.
